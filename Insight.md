🚀 Apollo Hospitals Report – Data-Driven Insights for Smarter Healthcare Decisions 🏥📊

I recently worked on an in-depth Apollo Hospitals analysis, leveraging Power BI & Power Query to uncover key insights from a dataset of 50K patient records. This dataset, generated using ChatGPT with a bit of creative prompting, provided a rich foundation for extracting valuable business intelligence.

🔍 Key Insights:
💰 Revenue: $6.3B total, with insurance leading at $5.1B.
🏥 Top Department: Cardiology (8.3K patients).
📊 Avg. Bill Per Patient: $127K.
📅 Revenue Trends: Peaks at $545M (Feb), dips at $482M (March).
⚕️ Common Diseases: Diabetes, Migraine, Skin Infections, Asthma & Cancer (~7.1K cases each).
📈 YoY Growth: 45.60% 🚀

🔧 ETL & Visualization:
✅ Power Query: Cleaned & transformed data, removed duplicates, handled data types.
📊 Power BI: Built interactive dashboards & visualizations.
🎨 PowerPoint: Designed reports tailored to client requirements.

💡 Data is powerful only when transformed into insights!
